Nekki Basara is a guitarist and a singer of the band Fire Bomber. Living in a less-developed part of the flying colony City 7 which is looking for a habitable planet, he composes and sings songs in the belief that music holds a greater power.<br><br>\nDuring its flight, an unknown alien race appeared and started laying siege upon City 7. However, its attacks are not conventional -- instead of trying to destroy them, they steal what is known as \"spiritia\", rendering victims unresponsive and zombie-like. During these battles, Basara always goes out into the middle of the warzone, singing his songs and expecting friend and foe to listen and be moved by his music.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","startDate":{"year":1994,"month":10,"day":16},"endDate":{"year":1995,"month":9,"day":24},"season":"FALL","seasonYear":1994,"episodes":49,"duration":25,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"ORIGINAL","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx1397-D9MLYHZhOnYO.png","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx1397-D9MLYHZhOnYO.png","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx1397-D9MLYHZhOnYO.png"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/1397-R8KenRg7Qerw.jpg","genres":["Action","Comedy","Drama","Mecha","Music","Sci-Fi"],"averageScore":70,"popularity":10306,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"PREQUEL","node":{"id":474,"title":{"romaji":"Macross Plus"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"SEQUEL","node":{"id":1398,"title":{"romaji":"Macross Dynamite 7"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"SIDE_STORY","node":{"id":1399,"title":{"romaji":"Macross 7 Encore"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"SIDE_STORY","node":{"id":1400,"title":{"romaji":"Macross 7: Ginga ga Ore wo Yonde Iru"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"SIDE_STORY","node":{"id":6209,"title":{"romaji":"Macross 7 Plus"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ALTERNATIVE","node":{"id":15177,"title":{"romaji":"Macross FB7: Ginga Rukon - Ore no Uta wo Kike!"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"SPIN_OFF","node":{"id":143426,"title":{"romaji":"Macross 7th Chord"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":35418,"title":{"romaji":"Macross 7 Trash"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"SPIN_OFF","node":{"id":196666,"title":{"romaji":"Valkyrie Rock"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"SPIN_OFF","node":{"id":198351,"title":{"romaji":"Macross 7 Gaiden: Ashita e no Etude"},"type":"MANGA"}}]}}
