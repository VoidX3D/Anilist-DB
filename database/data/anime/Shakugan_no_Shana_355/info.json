He named her Shana.<br><br>\nNot long after he enters high school, Sakai Yuji&rsquo;s normal days come to an end. He sees something bizarre on his way home: people are frozen in a strange fire, and a monster that looks like a large doll is attacking them. Just when he's about to be killed, a girl in a dark cloak wielding a large sword appears, and slices the monster in half. Although Yuji survives the strange encounter, the girl informs him of a desolate truth: \" 'You' don't exist anymore.\"<br><br>\nShe calls herself a Flame Haze who hunts \"Guze no Tomogara\"; intruders from another world. She explains to him that he is a \"Torch\", a substitute of Yuji whose &ldquo;existence&rdquo; has already been devoured. She also told him that he is a special Torch, \"Mystes\", which contains a precious item in it. When he looks at his chest, he sees within himself a faint flame, just as she said.<br><br>\nIt is in this way that his eternal struggle alongside the girl begins. <br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo) ","startDate":{"year":2005,"month":10,"day":6},"endDate":{"year":2006,"month":3,"day":23},"season":"FALL","seasonYear":2005,"episodes":24,"duration":24,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"LIGHT_NOVEL","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx355-tB52QB38leMs.png","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx355-tB52QB38leMs.png","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx355-tB52QB38leMs.png"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/355-HYE6kTOrxZpG.jpg","genres":["Action","Comedy","Drama","Fantasy","Romance","Supernatural"],"averageScore":70,"popularity":89777,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"SEQUEL","node":{"id":2787,"title":{"romaji":"Shakugan no Shana II (Second)"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":33074,"title":{"romaji":"Shakugan no Shana"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"SIDE_STORY","node":{"id":1531,"title":{"romaji":"Shakugan no Shana Special: Koi to Onsen no Kougai Gakushuu!"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"SIDE_STORY","node":{"id":6330,"title":{"romaji":"Shakugan no Shana: Naze Nani Shana"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"CHARACTER","node":{"id":6628,"title":{"romaji":"Dengeki Bunko 2007 Movie Festival Special"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"SIDE_STORY","node":{"id":1066,"title":{"romaji":"Shakugan no Shana Specials"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ALTERNATIVE","node":{"id":1815,"title":{"romaji":"Shakugan no Shana Movie"},"type":"ANIME"}}]}}
