The price on his head is a fortune, and his path of destruction reaches across the arid wastelands of a desert planet. Unfortunately, most encounters with the spiky-haired gunslinger don't end well for the bounty hunters who catch up with him; someone almost always gets hurt - and it's never Vash.<br>\n<br>\nOddly enough, for such an infamous fugitive, there's no proof that he's ever taken a life. In fact, he's a pacifist with a doughnut obsession who's more doofus than desperado. There's a whole lot more to him than his reputation lets on - Vash the Stampede definitely ain't your typical outlaw.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Funimation)","startDate":{"year":1998,"month":4,"day":1},"endDate":{"year":1998,"month":9,"day":30},"season":"SPRING","seasonYear":1998,"episodes":26,"duration":24,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"MANGA","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx6-wd4saT1JzStH.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx6-wd4saT1JzStH.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx6-wd4saT1JzStH.jpg"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/6-4pIR2RY8AHZ0.jpg","genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"averageScore":80,"popularity":152523,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":30703,"title":{"romaji":"Trigun"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"SIDE_STORY","node":{"id":4106,"title":{"romaji":"TRIGUN: Badlands Rumble"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":30704,"title":{"romaji":"Trigun Maximum"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"ALTERNATIVE","node":{"id":151040,"title":{"romaji":"TRIGUN STAMPEDE"},"type":"ANIME"}}]}}
