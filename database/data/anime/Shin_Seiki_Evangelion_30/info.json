The only hope for Mankind's survival lies in the Evangelion, a humanoid fighting machine developed by NERV, a special United Nations agency. Capable of withstanding anything the Angels can dish out, the Evangelion's one drawback lies in the limited number of people able to pilot them. Only a handful of teenagers, all born fourteen years ago, nine months after the Angels first appeared, are able to interface with the Evangelion. One such teenager is Shinji Ikari, whose father heads the NERV team that developed and maintains the Evangelion. Thrust into a maelstrom of battle and events that he does not understand, Shinji is forced to plumb the depths of his own inner resources for the courage and strength to not only fight, but to survive, or risk losing everything. <br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)<br>\n<br>\n <i>Note: Later releases include edited versions of Episodes 21-24 called the \"Director's Cut\" with some visual editing and adding extra scenes that appeared in the theatrical recap 'Death'.</i>","startDate":{"year":1995,"month":10,"day":3},"endDate":{"year":1996,"month":3,"day":27},"season":"FALL","seasonYear":1995,"episodes":26,"duration":24,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"ORIGINAL","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx30-AI1zr74Dh4ye.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx30-AI1zr74Dh4ye.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx30-AI1zr74Dh4ye.jpg"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/30-gEMoHHIqxDgN.jpg","genres":["Action","Drama","Mecha","Mystery","Psychological","Sci-Fi"],"averageScore":83,"popularity":434994,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"SEQUEL","node":{"id":32,"title":{"romaji":"Shin Seiki Evangelion Movie: Air / Magokoro wo, Kimi ni"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":30698,"title":{"romaji":"Shin Seiki Evangelion"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"SUMMARY","node":{"id":31,"title":{"romaji":"Shin Seiki Evangelion Movie: Shi to Shinsei"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"SPIN_OFF","node":{"id":4130,"title":{"romaji":"Petit Eva: Evangelion@School"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"OTHER","node":{"id":102096,"title":{"romaji":"Peaceful Times (F02) Petit Film"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ALTERNATIVE","node":{"id":55594,"title":{"romaji":"Evangelion: ANIMA"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"SPIN_OFF","node":{"id":101195,"title":{"romaji":"Shin Seiki Evangelion: Pikopiko Chuugakusei Densetsu"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"CHARACTER","node":{"id":125785,"title":{"romaji":"Evangelion x KATE CM"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"CHARACTER","node":{"id":125796,"title":{"romaji":"Evangelion × Attack ZERO"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"CHARACTER","node":{"id":100620,"title":{"romaji":"Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"CHARACTER","node":{"id":110131,"title":{"romaji":"Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion: Mirai kara Kita Shinsoku no ALFA-X"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"CHARACTER","node":{"id":128737,"title":{"romaji":"Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion Z"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"OTHER","node":{"id":171643,"title":{"romaji":"Mogami Sakura no Detama Hokan Keikaku - Kiseki no Kachi wa"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"OTHER","node":{"id":204270,"title":{"romaji":"Evangelion Shinsaku Tanpen Animation (Provisional Title)"},"type":"ANIME"}}]}}
