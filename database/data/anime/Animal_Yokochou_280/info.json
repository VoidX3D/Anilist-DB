{"id":280,"idMal":280,"title":{"romaji":"Animal Yokochou","english":"Animal Lane","native":"アニマル横町"},"type":"ANIME","format":"TV","status":"FINISHED","description":"On the first day her family moved to their new house, 5 year old Ami-chan made friends with three talking animals who came out of a door in her bedroom floor, which she finds out leads to Animal Yokocho, another world. The three are Issa, an overly innocent, soft-spoken panda, Kenta, a highly strung, red-scarf-loving bear who puts on an almost constant tough-guy act, and Iyo, a rabbit who usually holds her own well-being and enjoyment over the happiness (and safety) of her friends. Even at only 5 years old, Ami-chan is easily the most rational of the group, and she's a little wary at first, but she eventually comes around and starts spending her free time with them. A typical day involves Ami-chan and the three doing different things to pass the time, often playing a seemingly innocent game, but in AniYoko style. Unfortunately for Ami-chan, the AniYoko version usually turns out to be drastically different, much less logical, and usually more dangerous than the ordinary version.<br><br>\n5 year old kindergarten girl, Ami-chan, has a secret which cannot be revealed to anyone: that is, she spends her days with mysterious animals who come to her house. These animals include a rabbit by the name of Iyo, a bear named Kenta and a panda called Issa. They are actually from Anima Yokocho, the place that the secret door in Ami-chan's room leads to. And of course, other mysterious characters from Animal Yokocho will subsequently make their appearances as well...\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","startDate":{"year":2005,"month":10,"day":4},"endDate":{"year":2006,"month":9,"day":26},"season":"FALL","seasonYear":2005,"episodes":51,"duration":23,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"MANGA","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/280.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/280.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/280.jpg"},"bannerImage":null,"genres":["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy"],"averageScore":63,"popularity":1060,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":34096,"title":{"romaji":"Animal Yokocho"},"type":"MANGA"}}]}}
