Their efforts, however, are in vain as they fail to stop a nuclear warhead from hitting Shin Dragon, resulting in a massive Getter Ray contamination that wipes out 99% of the planet's population. Thirteen years after this great catastrophe, mankind continues to fight for survival against the Invaders. Out of the remains of the nuclear blast comes Shin Getter, piloted by the artificial human Go. With remnants of the Japanese military by his side, Go - along with co-pilots Kei and Gai - must use Shin Getter to exterminate the Invaders once and for all.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","startDate":{"year":1998,"month":8,"day":25},"endDate":{"year":1999,"month":5,"day":25},"season":"SUMMER","seasonYear":1998,"episodes":13,"duration":25,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"ORIGINAL","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx978-Tv9paCO7uQhJ.png","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx978-Tv9paCO7uQhJ.png","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx978-Tv9paCO7uQhJ.png"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/978-Eh5jBmAncg3i.jpg","genres":["Action","Adventure","Horror","Mecha","Sci-Fi"],"averageScore":77,"popularity":7407,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":31551,"title":{"romaji":"Getter Robo"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":40447,"title":{"romaji":"Getter Robo Go"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":38571,"title":{"romaji":"Shin Getter Robo"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"ALTERNATIVE","node":{"id":3579,"title":{"romaji":"Getter Robo"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":37759,"title":{"romaji":"Getter Robo G"},"type":"MANGA"}}]}}
