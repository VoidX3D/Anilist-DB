Deeply meditative and cooler than zero, the series follows the existential adventures of the apt marksman Kino along with talking motorcycle Hermes as they travel the world and learn much about themselves in the process. Imaginative, thought-provoking, and sometimes disturbing, Kino's journey is documented in an episodic style with an emphasis on atmosphere rather than action or plot, though still prevalent.","startDate":{"year":2003,"month":4,"day":8},"endDate":{"year":2003,"month":7,"day":8},"season":"SPRING","seasonYear":2003,"episodes":13,"duration":25,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"LIGHT_NOVEL","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx486-xXUgNOEBuxGs.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx486-xXUgNOEBuxGs.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx486-xXUgNOEBuxGs.jpg"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/486-cDPgzYdzHNEq.jpg","genres":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Psychological","Slice of Life"],"averageScore":81,"popularity":85989,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"PREQUEL","node":{"id":1379,"title":{"romaji":"Kino no Tabi: Nanika wo Suru Tame ni -life goes on.-"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":30399,"title":{"romaji":"Kino no Tabi: the Beautiful World"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"SIDE_STORY","node":{"id":3466,"title":{"romaji":"Kino no Tabi: the Beautiful World - Tou no Kuni: Free Lance"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"CHARACTER","node":{"id":6628,"title":{"romaji":"Dengeki Bunko 2007 Movie Festival Special"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ALTERNATIVE","node":{"id":98448,"title":{"romaji":"Kino no Tabi -the Beautiful World- the Animated Series"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"SIDE_STORY","node":{"id":2175,"title":{"romaji":"Kino no Tabi: the Beautiful World - Byouki no Kuni: For You"},"type":"ANIME"}}]}}
