Not just any kind of bread, though. He wants to make a bread that represents Japan itself and can stand toe-to-toe with rice as a national food. Thanks to his legendary \"Hands of the Sun,\" unnaturally warm hands that allow dough to ferment faster, Kazuma's bread is like a slice of Heaven.<br>\n<br>\nAnd when the Pantasia Rookie Competition arrives, everyone will get a taste of his skill! Along with his friend Kawachi (who's only in it for the dough), he’ll go up against koala karate masters, Harvard bread scientists, samurai with rolling-pin swords, and more! Can Kazuma create bread like naan other and bake his way to glory, or should he quit before he's toast?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Right Stuf)","startDate":{"year":2004,"month":10,"day":12},"endDate":{"year":2006,"month":3,"day":14},"season":"FALL","seasonYear":2004,"episodes":69,"duration":24,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"MANGA","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx28-QuKcZpUjTXzV.png","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx28-QuKcZpUjTXzV.png","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx28-QuKcZpUjTXzV.png"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/28-XGCH1SoNhyiC.jpg","genres":["Comedy"],"averageScore":75,"popularity":18742,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":30653,"title":{"romaji":"Yakitate!!
