She later turns out to be his cousin who he barely remembers from his childhood. Urara, who had felt something special for him (an other-than-cousinly-love), invites Touma to live with her since he has no place to stay other than the hotel room. Before taking the test, Touma meets Meiko Yotsuba, a beautiful, sophisticated woman also trying to get into Keio. Meiko gets into Keio but Touma does not, due to a cold Urara had given him shortly before. Although he did not make it, he pretends he does to earn the respect of Meiko. Touma is caught up in a love triangle with Urara and Meiko, while struggling to keep Meiko believing he's really a Keio student and still be there for Urara at the same time.","startDate":{"year":1997,"month":5,"day":21},"endDate":{"year":1997,"month":10,"day":22},"season":"SPRING","seasonYear":1997,"episodes":12,"duration":22,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"MANGA","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/b818-KJV5rnRLVKGZ.png","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/b818-KJV5rnRLVKGZ.png","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/b818-KJV5rnRLVKGZ.png"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/818-SF5ZhLnjcA3l.jpg","genres":["Comedy","Drama","Ecchi","Romance","Slice of Life"],"averageScore":57,"popularity":3670,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":31603,"title":{"romaji":"Sakura Tsuushin"},"type":"MANGA"}}]}}
