In opposition to this plan are the slightly nutty Kyuusaku Natsume and Nuku Nuku, the android who acts as a companion to his young son. Nuku Nuku's classmates are all eccentrics, Futaba, the class president, is a domineering control-freak, who cannot leave her authority in school. Chieko Shirakaba is the rich snob with the two yes-girls who always take her side. There is a bookworm, a mystic, a scientist, and a pop singer. All of these are true to their descriptions: the mystic is always foretelling doom via tarot cards, spirits, or some other occult technique. The pop singer never says anything except as a song. The bookworm always has her nose in a book. These eccentricities add to the series' humor.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","startDate":{"year":1998,"month":1,"day":7},"endDate":{"year":1998,"month":3,"day":25},"season":"WINTER","seasonYear":1998,"episodes":12,"duration":23,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"ORIGINAL","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx375-bY7XEqX2oCIl.png","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx375-bY7XEqX2oCIl.png","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx375-bY7XEqX2oCIl.png"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/375-Fv1UnMsti1m2.jpg","genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Mecha","Sci-Fi"],"averageScore":62,"popularity":2800,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"SIDE_STORY","node":{"id":3232,"title":{"romaji":"Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume Specials"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ALTERNATIVE","node":{"id":373,"title":{"romaji":"Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ALTERNATIVE","node":{"id":374,"title":{"romaji":"Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume DASH!"},"type":"ANIME"}},{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":92404,"title":{"romaji":"Shin Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume: Tanjou-hen"},"type":"MANGA"}}]}}
