He soon comes upon a whole forest full of \"useless animals\"-- that is, animals that don't live up to their species' usual character. After a short fight with the smoking, bad-tempered rabbit, Usahara, Uruno decides that he wants to move on... but changes his mind upon meeting Chiiko, a clumsy cheetah girl. It's love at first sight for Uruno, and after deciding to stay for her, he continues to hope that even though he's a good-for-nothing, he'll win her over someday. That is, if living with the other strange residents of the forest-- including the aformentioned smoking rabbit, a sake-drinking unicorn, a near-sighted eagle, an orca that cannot swim, and a shy pegasus --doesn't get to him first.","startDate":{"year":2005,"month":1,"day":17},"endDate":{"year":2005,"month":2,"day":21},"season":"WINTER","seasonYear":2005,"episodes":26,"duration":5,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"MANGA","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx485-JkVzRz4Dl1xD.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx485-JkVzRz4Dl1xD.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx485-JkVzRz4Dl1xD.jpg"},"bannerImage":null,"genres":["Comedy","Slice of Life"],"averageScore":64,"popularity":1840,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":34828,"title":{"romaji":"Damekko Doubutsu"},"type":"MANGA"}}]}}
