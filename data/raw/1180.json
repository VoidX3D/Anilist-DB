Most of her cases involve monsters infringing upon the rights of humans, who are protected by law from their generally more powerful neighbors. Being half-human and half cat-beast, Natsuki straddles the two societies and tries to understand and respect both while enforcing the law. She is assisted by a werewolf named Batanen who is afraid to admit he loves her; another werewolf named Tommy; and a Kyubi fox demon named Sakura who has her own plans--which include eating Natsuki to complete her her nine tails and thereby her magical powers.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","startDate":{"year":1997,"month":4,"day":3},"endDate":{"year":1997,"month":9,"day":25},"season":"SPRING","seasonYear":1997,"episodes":25,"duration":24,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"MANGA","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/1180.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/1180.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/1180.jpg"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/1180-9hP1TNzFodN9.jpg","genres":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"averageScore":65,"popularity":3056,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":30367,"title":{"romaji":"Hyper Police"},"type":"MANGA"}}]}}
