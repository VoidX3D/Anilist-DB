So why wait for an organ you need to become available? Raised to be harvested for parts, Ray had already lost her eyes when renegade surgeon Black Jack rescued her. Now, ten years later, she has grown up to be a surgeon herself. And thanks to the unique artificial eyes she received as replacements, she has a reputation for performing incredible medical operations that no one else could even attempt. But unknown to any but a select few, her surgical endeavors are only part of a greater mission: to discover what happened to the other children she was raised with, and to find the men who stole the eyes she was born with and to bring them to justice. <br><br>\n(Source: The Anime Network)","startDate":{"year":2006,"month":4,"day":5},"endDate":{"year":2006,"month":6,"day":28},"season":"SPRING","seasonYear":2006,"episodes":13,"duration":24,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"MANGA","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx919-5xFFHNsIkDsa.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx919-5xFFHNsIkDsa.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx919-5xFFHNsIkDsa.jpg"},"bannerImage":null,"genres":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"averageScore":62,"popularity":3644,"relations":{"edges":[{"relationType":"ADAPTATION","node":{"id":32913,"title":{"romaji":"RAY"},"type":"MANGA"}},{"relationType":"PARENT","node":{"id":2213,"title":{"romaji":"Black Jack (TV)"},"type":"ANIME"}}]}}
