Despite their difficult situation, they are still living reasonably happy and normal lives. However, everything is about to be flipped upside-down due to a secret government project. Due to increasingly low birth rates in Japan, the Japanese government is testing a program in which two young people are forced to marry. Ryo wants no part of it, but he is given little choice in the matter; his new fianc&eacute;e, Shizuka, comes to his home late one night with several dozen government issued bodyguards, who are there to ensure the success of the new couple. Unlike Ryo, Shizuka couldn&rsquo;t be more willing to go along with this new program, and eagerly goes about her wifely duties, despite his objections. With meddling friends, pushy bodyguards, and an overenthusiastic new fianc&eacute;e, Ryo&rsquo;s life has taken a turn in a direction the young man certainly didn&rsquo;t expect.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","startDate":{"year":2004,"month":10,"day":3},"endDate":{"year":2004,"month":12,"day":26},"season":"FALL","seasonYear":2004,"episodes":13,"duration":12,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"VISUAL_NOVEL","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx119-OitBgnCg8T7c.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx119-OitBgnCg8T7c.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/bx119-OitBgnCg8T7c.jpg"},"bannerImage":null,"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Romance","Slice of Life"],"averageScore":60,"popularity":5412,"relations":{"edges":[]}}
