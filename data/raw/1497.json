{"id":1497,"idMal":1497,"title":{"romaji":"Aru Machi Kado no Monogatari","english":"Tales of the Street Corner","native":"ある街角の物語"},"type":"ANIME","format":"MOVIE","status":"FINISHED","description":"The scene is set with a poster on a street corner, a girl who cherishes her teddy bear, a street lamp and a playful moth that is drawn to the lamp. These creatures and inanimate objects, each with their own dramas, get involved in a war and the story ends in a tragic climax. This is a private animated piece that expresses feelings rather than telling a story. It can be said that Tezuka Osamu, frustrated with working for big companies, made an attempt here to depict what he really wanted in his animation. This work illustrates that even a poster on the wall can have a vivid drama behind it, and brings the magic of animation alive for us.","startDate":{"year":1962,"month":11,"day":5},"endDate":{"year":1962,"month":11,"day":5},"season":"FALL","seasonYear":1962,"episodes":1,"duration":38,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"countryOfOrigin":"JP","source":"ORIGINAL","coverImage":{"extraLarge":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/1497.jpg","large":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/1497.jpg","medium":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/small/1497.jpg"},"bannerImage":"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/1497-qivayRHBmgOZ.jpg","genres":["Drama","Fantasy","Music","Romance"],"averageScore":62,"popularity":2059,"relations":{"edges":[]}}
